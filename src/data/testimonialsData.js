    comment: `Kathryn has helped us realise our vision of a 70’s inspired Palm Springs design for our new house.
    Her ideas were creative and true to the brief, whilst also being achievable and within budget.
    As we have been executing against the design over the past month, Kathryn has continued to be helpfully involved,
    responding to all our subsequent questions and providing further ideas beyond the original brief.
    Kathryn took all the stress and doubt out of the process for us, and we are really happy with the outcome.`

    yet warm and inviting. All of our redecorated areas looks so much larger also. Kathryn is so professional, 
    has some wonderful ideas and the products she recommends are all beautiful, it makes it difficult to choose! 
    Her presentations are amazing, she is very efficient and answers any enquiries so promptly. We would highly 
    recommend her! Many thanks again. It feels like we have moved into a new home.`

    comment: `We recently undertook a significant renovation on our house, and wanted to turn it from 1970’s brown 
    to contemporary Hamptons. Kathryn worked on the interiors, which included the kitchen, living room and bedrooms. 
    Kathryn was able to take our ideas and vision and turn them into something really unique. Kathryn was so easy to 
    work with and professional in her approach. I think one of the most valuable parts of the experience was that 
    Kathryn had access to suppliers and products that I would never had known existed.`

    comment: `I first came across Kathryn’s website when we finally made the decision to sell our unit. 
    I loved the styling she had created and thought she would be the right person to style our unit to ensure 
    we could make a good impression and get the best possible price. Kathryn made the entire process from start 
    to finish so easy with her professionalism and warm nature. Throughout the open houses, we received so much 
    feedback about how beautifully the unit was presented. Kathryn was able to style our unit to suit the type 
    of buyer we were aiming to attract. We would absolutely work with Kathryn again in the future.`

    comment: `When we decided to sell our house, we knew that our interiors needed an overhaul. 
    After doing some research, I found Kathryn’s website and loved her style. Dealing with Kathryn was an 
    absolute pleasure during the entire experience, she made everything very easy and liaised with our agents 
    to reduce our workload. We were extremely impressed with how the house looked and our agents were amazed 
    at the transformation. Ultimately we sold for a price that exceeded our initial hopes and that wouldn’t 
    have happened without Kathryn’s amazing work. We highly recommend Kathryn.`

    comment: `Kathryn has done outstanding work with us over the last few years. Helping us source furnishings
    that complement the design of our house whilst taking our own personal preferences into consideration.
    She has a magic touch for what decorations, colour schemes and textures work well together. She has sourced
    custom made carpets, dining tables, cabinets and various soft furnishings for us. We have been very impressed
    with the quality and design of every single item she has delivered. 
    It is very easy to work with Kathryn. She not only provides great advice on the spot, she also puts forward
    recommendations in a professional and timely manner and is meticulous in making sure orders are carried out
    smoothly. We feel we can put our full trust in Kathryn for upcoming projects.`

    Kathryn has a wonderful way of listening to what you want and making great suggestions. She is patient and
    always quick to respond to any questions you ask, no matter how many times you ask. She is very hands on and
    takes the time to work through ideas with you. We are very happy with the result and love the way our house

    we can enjoy and relax thanks to Kathryn! It's now my favourite room in the house! Kathryn understood the style
    I wanted and what would work in the room considering the budget and other pieces of existing furniture. She was
    professional and honest and easy to work with. The result is amazing and I can't wait for us to get started on
    our master bedroom next! Kathryn is amazing and I highly recommend her.`
