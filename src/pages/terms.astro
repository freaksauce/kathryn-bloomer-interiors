        As fabric rolls have different Dye lots, variation can occur from samples provided. Variations may occur in natural timber products. Due to the nature of timber being a
        natural product, variations in colour and the natural pattern may occur from the sample given.

      <p class="mb-4">
        Finish stain colours may differ slightly from samples shown. Please note this includes solid timber products, veneers and flooring. Please note imperfections, knots and
        cracks in timber products are a natural feature and not a fault and are an inherent feature of rustic timber furniture.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Please note paint colour may vary from brushed out swatch due to available light, colour mixing ratio, paint brand and type of paint used. Kathryn Bloomer Interiors is not
        liable for paint colour variation. Any dispute must be dealt with directly between the client and painter or manufacturer.
