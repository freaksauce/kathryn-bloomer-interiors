			What we do
		</h3>
		<div class="lg:grid grid-cols-2 gap-10 mb-20">
			<div class="">
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Custom Furniture and Upholstery
				</h4>
				<p>
					We can create a perfect piece of furniture designed to suit a specific
					space or shape. Our upholsterer/furniture maker is one of the most
					skilled makers in Sydney and produces pieces that are second to none
					in quality and workmanship. All of our custom upholstered pieces are
					created and made here in Sydney.
				</p>
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Custom Designed Cushions
				</h4>
				<p>
					We can create and design beautiful cushions to suit your bespoke
					interior. Whether it is a single cushion or numerous cushions for an
					entire home, our cushions are hand made here in Sydney and can be made
					in any fabric with quality feather inserts.
				</p>
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Art and accessories selection
				</h4>
				<p>
					With many contacts in the art and accessories industries we can find
					pieces to suit your budget and style. Art and accessories can pull the
					entire project together so are chosen with every detail in mind.
				</p>
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Flooring Selection
				</h4>
				<p>
					Flooring is one of the most important elements in a room. It is the
					basis for both the visual style of the interior and also needs to be
					one of the most functional and durable elements in the design.
				</p>
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Soft Furnishings and Window Treatments
				</h4>
				<p>
					We can custom design your curtains, blinds, rugs and more. Many
					factors are considered in the selection process and our knowledge and
					passion for beautiful fabrics helps us create window dressings that
					are visually stunning and durable.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="">
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Kitchen and bathroom selections
				</h4>
				<p>
					Our attention to detail is paramount when selecting hard finishes,
					tiles, tapware, benchtops, lighting, door hardware, and bathroom and
					kitchen products. Whilst keeping current trends in mind we are mindful
					that kitchen and bathrooms add value to a property and aesthetic
					longevity is important.
				</p>
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Lighting selection
				</h4>
				<p>
					From pendants to table lamps we can create a lighting design for you.
					We can custom make shades and have suppliers that are not readily
					available to the general public.
				</p>
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Colour Consultancy
				</h4>
				<p>
					With a strong background in colour and design our ability to create
					beautiful colour palettes and advise on paint choices will result in a
					fresh and contemporary home or commercial space. With experience
					consulting on both interior and exterior projects our use of colour is
					both unique and surprising. We have a flexible attitude towards colour
					and love both neutral colour schemes or bold saturated colour when
					desired.
				</p>
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Tradespeople and Suppliers
				</h4>
				<p>
					Our business couldnâ€™t function without the many highly skilled
					tradespeople that contribute to our work. From wallpaper hanging to
					installing curtains and blinds, we have a wide range of suppliers and
					people to call on.
				</p>
				<h4 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 mt-6 lg:mt-0">
					Project Management
				</h4>
				<p>
					We can be as involved as little or as much as you like. We an design,
					order and install all selected items for your home. From the initial
					decoartion scheme to the furnished room or house, we can manage the
					entireprocess.
